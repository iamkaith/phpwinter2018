## Working in PHP

# Lab 1
Getting used to bash, Composer, and Bcrypt

# Lab 2
First time using ZendSkeletonApplication and purpose of lab was to get used to basic routing. Pages used Parallax template by Materialize CSS just for fun.

# Lab 3
Tried using a form and performed some basic input validation and small view presentation change so user can see if validation passed or not. TODO: update the view, enclose the message in a pretty Bootstrap alert-style div.
