## Working in PHP

## Lab 1
Getting used to bash, Composer, and Bcrypt

## Lab 2
First time using ZendSkeletonApplication and purpose of lab was to get used to basic routing. Pages used Parallax template by Materialize CSS just for fun.

## Lab 3
Tried using a form and performed some basic input validation and small view presentation change so user can see if validation passed or not. 

##Lab 4
GET request with name params. Router configured to take key-value pair (name=xxx) or /:name params which is then processed by the Controller. The last part, /:name, was an optional challenge where digging through some documentation was necessary as ZF2 allows constraints so only valid URLs are accepted otherwise a 404 page is thrown.
